# Pandas_Project_Dio
A Pandas/Matplotlib project for the Cognizant Cloud Data Engineer from Digital Inovation One

This project consisted of using what whe learn in the Pandas module of the Cognizant Cloud Data Engineer bootcamp to make a project.

the main goal here was to load a dataset of our choice into a pandas dataframe and the use matplotlib to help with the visualization of the data
and then generate valueable info with it.

i decided to use an airforce dataset that cointained info about air accidents, i used it to show the types of veichles with the higher amount of accidents
in which segment thoses vehicles where and in which operation phase they where when the accident happend and the states with the higher amount of accidents,
i then show the same info as above but filtered expecificaly for the 3 states with the higher amount of accidents and finally how much damage the vehicles 
involved in the accidents suffered.
